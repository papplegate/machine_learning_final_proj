This Github repository contains code and a report that provides my solution to the final project in the *Practical Machine Learning* course taught by Jeff Leek on Coursera.  

You can view the report by clicking on `applegate_report.pdf` in the list of files above or by clicking on the following link to view the `.html` page: http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/papplegate/machine_learning_final_proj/blob/master/applegate_report.html

`test3.R` contains the R code I used to carry out the machine learning exercise.
